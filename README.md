This repository explores Deep domain adaptation to extract features from source and target set to generalize the model and to better predict the labels.
The most recent version is 5 and should be used to train and test the dataset.
Specifically files - 
1) new_resnet_Jainik_model_domain_adaptation_5.py
2) new_train_Jainik_model_domain_adaptation_5.py
should be used for training and testing the model.
